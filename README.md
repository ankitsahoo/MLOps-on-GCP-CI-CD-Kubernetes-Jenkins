**How These Tools & Techniques Help**
-**Experiment Tracking & Model Management**
  Helps in logging, comparing, and tracking different ML model experiments.
  MLFlow & Comet-ML provide centralized tracking of hyperparameters and performance metrics.
  
**Data & Code Versioning**
Ensures reproducibility by tracking data changes over time.
DVC manages large datasets, and GitHub/GitLab maintains version control for code and pipelines.

**CI/CD Pipelines & Automation**
Automates ML workflows from model training to deployment.
Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and ArgoCD handle continuous integration & deployment.

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
GCP provides scalable infrastructure for data storage, model training, and deployment.
Minikube enables Kubernetes testing on local machines before deploying to cloud environments.

**Deployment & Containerization**
Docker containerizes applications, making them portable and scalable.
Kubernetes manages ML deployments for high availability and scalability.

**Data Engineering & Feature Storage**
PostgreSL & Redis store structured and real-time ML features.
Airflow automates ETL pipelines for seamless data processing.

**ML Monitoring & Drift Detection**
Prometheus & Grafana visualize ML model performance in real-time.
Alibi-Detect helps in identifying data drift and model degradation.

**API & Web App Development**
FastAPI & Flask create APIs for real-time model inference.
ChatGPT integration enhances chatbot-based ML applications.
SwaggerUI & Postman assist in API documentation & testing.
